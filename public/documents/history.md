### History of 0xBTC

  0xBTC was deployed to the Ethereum Mainnet in the following transaction in 2018:

[https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5cdcd05f9d6e53e4be3c48095d95caa9d71f0c28f2bd5fe0ab4deeb20b75c026](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5cdcd05f9d6e53e4be3c48095d95caa9d71f0c28f2bd5fe0ab4deeb20b75c026)

At the time of launch, the only mining software capable of finding solutions was written in Node.JS and used the CPU.  No GPU mining software had been developed.  

In the months shortly following the launch, the 0xBTC community including users known as 'LT.Tofu','Mikers','MVI','Lodge', and 'InfernalToast' raced to build faster mining software for the community before private miners could do the same, which would allow them to acquire vast amounts of the token compared to the greater community.   


02/06/2018 Infernal_Toast deploys [the 0xBTC contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb6ed7644c69416d67b522e20bc294a9a9b405b31)  on MAINNET

02/06/2018 Infernal_Toast releases the [NodeJS CPU Miner](https://github.com/0xbitcoin/0xbitcoin-miner) and announcements are made on /r/0xbitcoin , /r/tokenmining, /r/ethtraderpro, and /r/ethereum.

02/07/2018 A handful of miners are now slowly mining 0xBTC, discord community starts to appear

02/18/2018 Discord community realizes that some accounts are mining WAY more blocks than the rest of us and we suspect someone built a faster GPU miner (in fact it was only a much better C++ miner) so a bounty was announced

02/21/2018 A community member named Zegordo comes forth and releases their faster C++ based extension for the CPU Miner This code is pulled into official miner repo which speeds up mining by 100x. Difficulty skyrockets and in general everyone feels as though they are back on the same playing field. Now we know it is a race for a GPU miner and only a matter of time.

02/25/2018 The community believes that there is already someone mining on the network with a GPU miner (it turns out that it is a solo anonymous programmer named Pizza)

02/28/2018 The first mining pool is released at TokenMiningPool.com https://github.com/0xbitcoin/tokenpool

03/01/2018 Pizza releases a mining pool at GPU.pizza which allows for closed-source GPU miningwith a locked miner. TokenMiningPool can only allow CPU mining still and so loses hashrate share

03/08/2018 The first open source GPU miner releases for CUDA (Nvidia cards) and it is able to mine at tokenminingpool.com and mike.rs pools

03/10/2018 A user named MiningVisualizer releases an AMD GPU miner out of nowhere (!) called the MVI Miner. Everyone rejoices and can mine on tokenminingpool.com. More open-source friendly pools appear such as mike.rs shortly after and they gain share over GPU.pizza pool.

03/20 The 0xBitcoin whitepaper is released https://github.com/0xbitcoin/white-paper  

03/24/2018 The EIP918 spec based on 0xBitcoin protocol is pulled into Ethereum Master https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/918  

05/26/2018 Mercatox adds 0xBitcoin trading pairs

06/01/2018 0xBitcoin is added to CMC
