### Getting Started with Ethereum

0xBitcoin is the canonical Proof-of-Work mined ERC20 token within the Ethereum Network.

The Ethereum Network is a decentralized database and protocol that has hyper-redundancy of data, meaning that all data is replicated to more than 1000 nodes around the world.  In order to store data in this global database, you need to pay fees to the nodes using a currency called Ether.


#### Using Ethereum On the Web
In order to get started using Ethereum on the internet, your web browser will need to be able to communicate with the Ethereum node using the Ethereum Protocol.  If you are using a traditional Web Browser, simply download and install Metamask Plugin for this purpose.

#### Metamask  
Once you have installed Metamask, open the plugin and follow the prompts to create your first Ethereum Account.  This account has a Public Address, similar to a bank account number, which you can use to receive funds.  If you know the Public Address of another person, you can send ETH and tokens to their account using Metamask.  The plugin's 'Expanded View' is very useful for this purpose.  

#### Getting some Ether
Now that you have Metamask installed, you will need some ETH in your account to interact with the Ethereum network and pay for gas fees.  You can purchase this currency on Centralized Exchanges such as Coinbase.com, Gemini.com and Binance.com.  

#### Decentralized Applications
Once you have Ether (ETH) in your Metamask account, you can visit Ethereum-enabled websites to spend your ETH or invest the currency in order to acquire different assets.

#### A Brief History
Unlike Bitcoin, the initial supply of Ether currency was created all at once by a centralized group called the Ethereum Foundation who started with 50 Million ETH as written in the code; not created using Proof of Work.  These Ether coins were sold on the free market to investors in 2014.

 While additional Ether has been mined since then, there is no supply limit. In this way, many see Ether primarily as a 'fuel' or as a 'lifeblood' to operate the Ethereum Network as opposed to a scarce and neutral currency optimized for financial transactions and storage of wealth.  The Ethereum Foundation has stated that it plans to transition new acquisition of ETH to a 'Proof of Stake' model instead of 'Proof of Work'.  Fortunately, even past that date, 0xBitcoin will always be a scarce Proof of Work currency running on the Ethereum Network.
