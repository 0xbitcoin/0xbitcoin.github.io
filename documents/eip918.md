### EIP918 Token Mining

 0xBitcoin, the first EIP918 Mineable for Ethereum, is mined using a simple Keccak256 (Sha3) algorithm using the following methodology:


``` js
   keccak256(nonce, minerEthAddress, challengeNumber) < difficultyTarget
```

The nonce is a random number selected by the mining software.  The mining software mines to try to find a valid nonce.  If the above statement evaluates to true, then the nonce is a valid solution to the proof of work.   The challengeNumber is just a recent Ethereum block hash.  Every round, the challengeNumber updates to the most recent Ethereum block hash so future works cannot be mined in the past.  The miner's Ethereum Address is part of the hashed solution so that when a nonce solution is found, it is only valid for that particular miner and man in the middle attacks cannot occur, preventing cheating during pool mining.  The difficulty target becomes smaller and smaller automatically as more hashpower is added to the network.

## Pool Mining

When mining 0xBitcoin, whenever a miner submits a solution, the miner must pay a small gas fee in order to execute the Ethereum smart contract code for the mint() function.  If the gas fee is too low, the solution will take too long to be mined and if difficulty is not at equillibrium then another mint() solution from another miner will likely be mined first.  This renders the original miners solution invalid and the transaction will revert().  To alleviate gas fees for miners, they can instead mine into a pool.  This way, the pool will then submit the solutions to the smart contract and pay a gas fee.  Then the pool will typically take a small percent of the rewards and give the rest to the miner for providing the PoW solution.  

Since the miner's ethereum address is included in the proof of work, pools require that miners mine using the pool's ethereum address.  This way, the miner cannot submit full solutions to the contract while only giving partial solutions to the pool.  If the miner is mining on behalf of the pool (using the pools address in the PoW algorithm) then it will not be able to submit any of those solutions to the smart contract without a revert().  This allows pools to operate without being cheated by the miners.     

Typically, a pool will accept 'partial solutions' from miners which means the miners will receive 'shares' from the pool for solutions that are close to valid but not quite valid.  This follows the same methodology as Bitcoin and Ethereum Proof of Work pool mining.  Probability theory states that, given enough close solutions, a full solution will eventually be found.  

## Smart Contract

Typically, ERC20 tokens will grant all tokens to the owner or will have an ICO which demands that amounts of Ether be sent to the owner for an initial offering of tokens.  Instead of granting tokens to the 'contract owner', all 0xBitcoin tokens are locked within the smart contract initially. These tokens are dispensed, 50 at a time, by calling the function 'mint' and using Proof of Work, similar to mining bitcoin classic. The 0xBitcoin smart contract is the first token to adhere to the ERC541 Draft Specification. As such the following Smart Contract methods are explicitly supported:

## Token
### ERC-20 Interface
#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"0xBitcoin Token"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function name() constant returns (string name)
```

#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. e.g. `"0xBTC"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() constant returns (string symbol)
```

#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() constant returns (uint256 totalSupply)
```

#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint256 balance)
```

### Mining Operations


#### mint

Returns a flag indicating a successful hash digest verification. In order to prevent MiTM attacks, it is recommended that the digest include a recent ethereum block hash and msg.sender's address. Once verified, the mint function calculates and delivers a mining reward to the sender and performs internal accounting operations on the contract's supply.

``` js
function mint(uint256 nonce, bytes32 challenge_digest) public returns (bool success)
```

##### *Mint Event*

Upon successful verification and reward the mint method dispatches a Mint Event indicating the reward address, the reward amount, the epoch count and newest challenge number.

``` js
event Mint(address indexed from, uint reward_amount, uint epochCount, bytes32 newChallengeNumber);
```

#### getChallengeNumber

Recent ethereum block hash, used to prevent pre-mining future blocks.

``` js
function getChallengeNumber() public constant returns (bytes32)
```

#### getMiningDifficulty

The number of digits that the digest of the PoW solution requires which typically auto adjusts during reward generation.Return the current reward amount. Depending on the algorithm, typically rewards are divided every reward era as tokens are mined to provide scarcity.


``` js
function getMiningDifficulty() public constant returns (uint)
```

#### getMiningReward

Return the current reward amount. Depending on the algorithm, typically rewards are divided every reward era as tokens are mined to provide scarcity.

``` js
function getMiningReward() public constant returns (uint)
```

### Mining Debug Operations


#### getMintDigest

Returns a test digest using the same hashing scheme used when minting new tokens.

``` js
function getMintDigest(uint256 nonce, bytes32 challenge_digest, bytes32 challenge_number) public view returns (bytes32 digesttest)
```
OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


#### checkMintSolution

Verifies a sample solution using the same scheme as the mint method.

``` js
function checkMintSolution(uint256 nonce, bytes32 challenge_digest, bytes32 challenge_number, uint testTarget) public view returns (bool success)
```
OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

## Minting New 0xBitcoins

The 0xBitcoin Token was deployed to the Ethereum blockchain in February, 2018, with the following attributes:
* No pre-mine
* No ICO
* 21,000,000 tokens total supply
* Difficulty target auto-adjusts with PoW hashrate
* Rewards decrease as more tokens are minted
* ERC20 compatibility

As such, the only way for a user to acquire 0xBitcoins is to mine them or purchase them from miners on decentralized exchanges. The mint function is responsible for verifying the validity of the hash solution, updating the contracts internal state and issuing new 0xBitcoins.

``` js
function mint(uint256 nonce, bytes32 challenge_digest) public returns (bool success) {   
    uint reward_amount = getMiningReward();

    bytes32 digest =  keccak256(challengeNumber, msg.sender, nonce );

    if (digest != challenge_digest) revert();

    //the digest must be smaller than the target
    if(uint256(digest) > miningTarget) revert();

    uint hashFound = rewardHashesFound[digest];
    rewardHashesFound[digest] = epochCount;
    if(hashFound != 0) revert();  //prevent the same answer from awarding twice

    balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].add(reward_amount);

    tokensMinted = tokensMinted.add(reward_amount);

    //set readonly diagnostics data
    lastRewardTo = msg.sender;
    lastRewardAmount = reward_amount;
    lastRewardEthBlockNumber = block.number;

    //start a new round of mining with a new 'challengeNumber'
     _startNewMiningEpoch();

    Mint(msg.sender, reward_amount, epochCount, challengeNumber );

    return true;
}
```
